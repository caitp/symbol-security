===========================

Tests the behaviour of different kinds of accesses to Well-Known Symbols (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-well-known-symbols)

This is a work in progress, but ideally it should be as complete as possible.

This could really be used to test other browsers, but I'm using it to test the behaviour of Firefox.

Want to add an additional test? There is a lot more to do here, more internal methods to be tested, more spec-defined uses of the properties to be tested.
